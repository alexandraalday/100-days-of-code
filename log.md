### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 1.25 hours // Started working on my portfolio page challenge. 

**Thoughts:** After working on my tribute page, I wish I knew more Bootstrap. I think I will focus on using Bootstrap for this challenge and try to stay asway from custom CSS.
