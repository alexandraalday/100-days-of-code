**Thoughts:** pdx snowpocalypse day 8 = we are melting! Started my random quote generator tonight. Feeling pumped to finally be on projects again. So frustrating, overwhelming, and fun! Decided against Kanye Tweets and went with my original idea of ancient figures. We'll be quoting their most snarkiest lines. >:)

### Day 16-32: January 18 - Feb 4, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Many, many hours // Finished random quote generator and more CSS/HTML and Git Tracks on CodeSchool. Getting more comfortable with using git from the console. 

**Thoughts:** Trying not to let life's obligations get me down about not being able to update here more often. Coding practice occurs late at night when everything else is done and I tend to go straight to bed afterwards.
