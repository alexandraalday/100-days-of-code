### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour // Spent time doing the HTML/CSS path on CodeSchool.

**Thoughts:** I realized yesterday, that I need more time in front end foundations so I'm not having to look everything up every two seconds.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours // Finished up the skeleton code for my portfolio page. 

**Thoughts:** Would have kept going all night, but exhausted. Can't wait to get up early tomorrow and finish adding all the design elements and hopefully some JS for some smooth transitions.
